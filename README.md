# 💰 Nexo Savings Automation with 🛠️ UI Vision RPA

This 📂 contains an automation project designed to enhance daily 💵-Cost Averaging (DCA) activities on Nexo savings accounts. Since Nexo does not provide an 🖥️ API for savings functionalities, this solution leverages 🛠️ UI Vision RPA to streamline these processes, ensuring optimal returns on 💎.

## ⭐ Features

- **🤖 Manual DCA Execution**: Allows for manual execution of daily DCA operations on Nexo savings accounts.
- **📈 Asset Optimization**: Maximizes potential returns by ensuring timely and precise execution of strategies.

## 📋 Requirements

To use this automation, ensure the following tools and environments are set up:

- [🛠️ UI Vision RPA](https://ui.vision/): Installed and configured on your system.
- A modern web browser compatible with 🛠️ UI Vision RPA (e.g., 🌐 Google Chrome, 🦊 Mozilla Firefox).
- Nexo savings account credentials.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this 📂:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cj4c0b1/Nexodca.git
   ```

2. Install and configure 🛠️ UI Vision RPA as per the [📖 official documentation](https://ui.vision/rpa/docs).

3. Import the JSON or ZIP scripts from the `scripts` 📂 into 🛠️ UI Vision RPA in your browser.

   **🔒 Note**: There is no configuration file like `config.json`. You must log in manually to your Nexo account before executing the script.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Log in manually to your Nexo account using your browser.
2. Open the 🛠️ UI Vision RPA extension and load the imported scripts.
3. Execute the desired script directly through the 🛠️ UI Vision RPA interface.
